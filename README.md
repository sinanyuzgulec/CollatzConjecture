What is Collatz Conjecture?


The Collatz conjecture, also known as conjecture , conjecture of Ulam or problem of Syracuse, is a conjecture of number theory established by Lothar Collatz in 1937 and says the following: If is an even number, divide it by 2 until you reach an odd number or 1, if is an odd number different from 1, multiply it by 3 and add 1 and start the process of dividing by 2, the final result will always be 1. The above means that this process always ends when being , because the successive division k times 2 of is 1. Formally, this equates to a function f:Nâ†¦N, such that: f(n)= { (n/2, or (3n+1)/2, or n=2^k, or (3n+1)/2=2^k)
